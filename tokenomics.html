  <h2>Total Supply</h2>

  <div class="distribution">
    <p><strong>Public ‚Äì 90% (900 M)</strong> 100% of the public allocation is available to buy at launch.</p>
    <p><strong>Family ‚Äì 6% (60 M)</strong> Allocated across three family segments (2% each). Family sales will be <em>controlled and paced</em> to maintain chart stability.</p>
    <p><strong>Developer ‚Äì 2% (20 M)</strong> Held in a multisig and streamed via vesting. Never market-sold to demonstrate long-term commitment.</p>
    <p><strong>Marketing & Promotion ‚Äì 1% (10 M)</strong> Managed by multisig and streamed. Used strictly for marketing, partnerships and growth.</p>
    <p><strong>Community ‚Äì 1% (10 M)</strong> Managed by multisig and streamed. Used for prizes, rewards and community events.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="note">
    At launch we will perform an <strong>Initial Buy targeting 10% of supply</strong> and immediately split the tokens into the wallets above.
    Multisig addresses and stream/vesting txs will be published for transparency.

  <h2>Family Token Allocation</h2>
  <p>
    Now, you might be wondering what this Family Token Allocation is all about, let me explain.
    Fugg the Rugg is a family project, created not only to be a Safe Haven for Crypto Enthusiasts who have been burned by Rug Pulls in the past, but to also be a quality Project that will hopefully make us all some money as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, in accordance with Transparency, it will be stated here that during Launch, 6% of the Total Supply of Coins will be allocated to the Developer‚Äôs Family, which is divided into 3 Segments. This means that each segment will initially hold 2% of the Total Supply which can be sold in a controlled release to secure Profits.
  </p>
  <p>
    The selling of the Coins will take place in a controlled fashion that will not hurt the Project or the Chart ‚Äì <strong>No Dumping!!</strong><br>
    We encourage our Investors to do the same, sell with a Conscience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each segment may also Buy Back Coins to Top Up their Supply, but it will never exceed 2%.
