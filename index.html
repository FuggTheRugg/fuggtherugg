      <p>Fugg the Rugg was created out of the need for a quality, honest project in these turbulent times in the Meme Coin World. 
      
        Fugg was created to be a Beacon of Light and a Safe Haven in these dark times and to provide a safe and profitable Project full of transparency and community engagement. 
      
        Fugg the Rugg was woven with an unpullable Thread. This grants him great stability, causing him to be an unpullable Rug. Meaning, he cannot and will never be pulled, therefore, you will never be scammed by us!</p>
      <p>So, if youâ€™re tired of being rugged, check out Fugg the Rugg!</p>

      <h3>Hi, my name is Fugg!</h3>
      <div class="comic-box">
        <p>
          Unlike your ordinary Rug,<br>
          Iâ€™ve been woven with an unpullable Thread.<br>
          So go ahead,<br>
          Give me a Tug,<br>
          See if Iâ€™ll move,<br>
          See if Iâ€™ll budge.<br>
          Because I wonâ€™t,<br>
          This I promise you!<br><br>

          Although I am one,<br>
          Rugs, I do not like!<br>
          They make me boil with Rage!<br>
          One might,<br>
          Say I too am a Rug,<br>
          I agree to disagree.<br>
          I love feet, toes and heels,<br>
          Take off your Socks,<br>
          Step on me and feel the Love,<br>
          From me, Fugg, The unpullable Rugg!
